                <h1>The UPS Store</h1>
                <p>1807 Market Blvd Hastings, MN 55033 - 651-438-5460</p>

            <div id="chester">
              <div id="left-arm">
                  <p>This is the left-arm of the website. The heart is flanked by two right and left columns. I was planning on using the columns as permanent objects on each page. They would be used to help the navigation across the site. For example, I could post links to the other pages of my website by using an list without the bullet points removed (list-style: none). Because they would be on every page, it would be easier to click on any one of the links and navigate directly to the page you want to visit. This column is made by using a flexbox and centering the content inside of it. It is given a width of 200 pixels and is not allowed to shrink by setting its "flex-shrink" to 0. Both columns and the heart are actually three different children in a flexbox set in the chester tag. The chester area is the middle area of the page that does not include the header or footer. It sets its children to align in a row and stretch to fit the page as well as fill the gaps inbetween each other.</p>

              <div id="heart">
                <p>Welcome to the official website for The UPS Store located in Hastings, MN! Owned by Jim Baisch and managed by Emily Garza, The UPS Store has been helping Hastings with all their printing and shipping needs for over 20 years! </p>
              </div>
              <div id="right-arm">
                <p>This is obviously the right column. Instead of having permanent links like the left column, I intend to put some testemonials from previous customers about their experiences and feelings about the store. This column is made the same way as the right column. </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <footer>
                <p>Lastly, we have the footer of the page. This is always going to be on the bottom, obviously, and I am planning on putting all the normal business information you would usually find down here; "About Us" information, phone number, address, hours of operation, etc. </p>

                Editor's note: I still need to learn a lot about this layout and understand that my knowledge about the layout is quite elemntary. I have some ideas about how to make this look a little cleaner, but do not quite know how to implement them, and will ask the TA how to start working mon my ideas. (Like how to get rid of this giant white space above, I am guessing it has to do something with flex-grow)
