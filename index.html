          <h3>Customer Testimonials:</h3>
          <b><u>Claudia K. :</u></b>The UPS Store has always been there for me, even when I am working in a time pinch! The team there is always attentive, effecient, and ready to help at a moment's notice. If any of my friends need any printing done, whether it is a business event or their kid's birthday party, I always tell them The UPS Store is the way to go!
          <p></p>
          <b><u>Amber Q. :</u></b>I have been a customer at The UPS Store for the full 25 years they have been serving the Hastings community, and even through 2 owner changes, they have always been the most reliable printing and shipping service here! I have never had a package break during shipment after having it professionally packed at the store, and even then, they always offer me the option of insurance to make me at ease while my goods are shipped. Highly recommend for anyone who has any printing or shipping needs!
