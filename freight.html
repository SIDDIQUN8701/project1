          Any package exceeding 150 pounds or bigger than 75 inches in any dimension is not valid for regular transport and must go through UPS Freight. UPS Freight is a more commercially used branch of UPS Shipping, but still essential nonetheless. If you're in the middle of a move and don't have any room in the truck for the furniture, or you're a company looking to transport your equipment to different stores around the continental United States, UPS Freight is the shipping choice for you. Because of the complicated nature of UPS Freight, we advise you visit the "Freight" page on the UPS Corporate website tab located at the top of your screen for more information.

          <h3>Customer Testimonials:</h3>
          <b><u>Cranky Ape</u></b><br>
          The mechanical equipment we use and transport at our many facilities here at Cranky Ape are extremely expensive and fragile. UPS Freight enables my business to transport these machines across the country with ease. Their trucks are designed to pickup and drop-off packages weighing over 150 pounds up to a couple tons, and all the packing is done by them! My employees only need to prep the machine for transportation and UPS Freight takes care of the rest!
          <p><b><u>Lou's Mechanics</u></b><br>
            Car parts are never light and easy to handle, let alone ship across the country. That's why whenever one of my shops needs a restocking of some engine blocks or other heavy parts, we always use UPS Freight. No other shipping company has the efficay of UPS Freight, and certainly not for the price they offer. The only thing I would change about UPS Freight is if they would let me do some of the work!</p>
          <p><b><u>Will P.</u></b><br> 
            When I had to help my grandmother move out of her home after she wanted to move into a smaller home, I didn't know what I was going to do. I couldn't move all of the furniture myself, and I certainly didn't have the time to rent a truck and drive all her stuff down there myself! Luckily, my friend told me to try UPS Freight and boy, was that a game changer! UPS Freight helped me package everything up and get it ready for transit, they even loaded all the packages on the truck for me! Now my grandmother is resting easy in her new home and it's all thanks to UPS Freight!</p>
