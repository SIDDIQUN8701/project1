            Here at The UPS Store, our main field expertise is what you know and love UPS for: shipping! We offer both ground and air services for domestic and international packages. You can bring in your item pre-packaged, otherwise you can bring just the item and we can have one of our certified packers package the item for you. Pre-packaging saves you the cost of having us package it, however the insurance that comes with the package will not cover any damage that occurs during transit; it will only reimburse you if the package is lost. Most packages packed by customers usually have a higher chance of breaking than a package packed by our store hence why we suggest customers shipping fragile items let us package your item so you can rest easy knowing your package will arrive in one piece. Here is a list of shipping services that we offer and shipping time associated with that service:
              <ul>
              <li><b>UPS Ground:</b></li>
                <li class="inner">
                  <ul>
                    <li>5-7 business days (Packages are not in transit on Sunday)</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

              <li><b>UPS 2nd Day Air:</b></li>

            <p>Lastly, we are also a USPS hub! Feel free to drop off any US mail you need sent out and it will be sent out the same day! While you're dropping off your mail, why don't you also check out our official USPS mailboxes that we offer? That's right, at The UPS Store, you can register for your own P.O Box! Redirect all your mail and packages to one place, with extra security as well! All packages are stored behind our counter in a safe location, and all you have to do is walk right on in and we can give you all your mail and packages. We can even hold your mail while you're on vacation, or send your mail directly to you if you prefer! These are just a few of the extra benefits you get when you sign up for a mailbox at The UPS Store than at the post office. Come on in today and see if a P.O Box is right for you!</p>

            <h3>Customer Testimonials:</h3>
            <p><b><u>Tyler E.</u></b><br>
            I have shipped through the USPS, FedEx, DHL, and UPS, and UPS definitely gave me the easiest and cheapest experience by far. Their employees are extremely helpful and knowledgable about UPS shipping and the best way to ship my package. All I had to do was bring in the item, and they were able to package and ship it, with insurance! I will always use UPS for my shipping needs, they're the best!</p>

            <p></p><b><u>Owen D. :</u></b><br>
            I run an at home business and I use UPS to ship all my packages, both domestically and internationally. Their prices are great and the whole process only takes a couple of minutes on my end, and they take care of the rest. They even help me with returns from customers, and it has never been easier. My business has been able to grow and succeed thanks to UPS, and it wouldn't be where it is today if it wasn't for them!
