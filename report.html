        <h1><u>Student Critique:</u></h1>
        <p>I believe my website meets all the requirements listed on the website. It contains 5 separate pages: Home, Shipping Services, Printing Services, Freight, and the Contact Us page. There is a header on each page stating the company name and their information. There is a navigation bar at the top with a link to each page, as well as an external link to the official UPS page. Images are re-sized for different sized screens and the layout of the page turns into one large, singular column for easier vertical navigation. All 5 pages share a global holy grail type layout. Each image has an alt attribute that describes the general idea of the picture. Each tab has its own favicon. All files are appropriatly named and sorted into thei respective folders. The website was not built with any frameworks or libraries (I think that is quite obvious). Each page passes the HTML validator test, as well as the CSS sheet. My website is up and running and is served through the 8443 port. The header and the body have two different fonts and text sizes. There is a contact form in the Contact Us page. My HTML is readable and uses conventional naming. Lastly, the form uses a CSS animation. Therefore, I believe my website meets all requirements listed.</p>
        <h1><u>Client Critique</u></h1>
        <p>The homepage design has a very “welcoming” feel where the home page literally welcomes you as it’s first line.  I like the use of pictures of multiracial UPS employees showing the store being inclusive.  I also like that the alternate stores are listed on the left hand side so any customer can see a store closer to them. I would prefer that there is a link to either their store website or at least to a map locator. A lot of information is given in on the homepage, shipping and freight. As a customer I would prefer to see bullet points of services available as shown in the Printing services. This way I can quickly glance each section and see what UPS can do for me. For example, I would completely miss that I can do Amazon returns in the Shipping Services because it is a paragraph I have to take time to read.  Having the testimonials on the same pages is reassuring of customer satisfaction and experience for general and specific services.</p>
